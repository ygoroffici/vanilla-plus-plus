# Run the generic function, which summons the armour stand. The name is a leftover from when it did more things than just that.
# Specifically, I was trying to develop an ultra-precise system for determining the height of the footprint and preventing overlap.
# It'd summon around 20 small armor stands with slight offsets around the area, then after giving them some time to fall, pick the lowest one nearest to the center.
# This would ensure the footprint would be as low as possible, which is typically what you'd want for a block (far less overhangs). I scrapped the feature later in development for performance reasons.

# Alternate between left and right footprints, using a temporary objective to ensure only one of the functions runs. We'll set the height of the current block with this offset in mind.
